1. Add the dependency to your project. For example with maven:

<dependency>
    <groupId>be.woutschoovaerts</groupId>
    <artifactId>mollie</artifactId>
    <version>3.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Build a client
```
Client client = new ClientBuilder()
                       .withApiKey("test_hW7trRMaJphr8feGzMNtd5SwShQSwg")
                       .build();
```

3. Use the client to execute whatever action you want to do. For example retrieving a payment:
```
PaymentResponse payment = client.payments().getPayment("my-payment-id");
```
